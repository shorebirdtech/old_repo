Not sure where this belongs, but writing it down.

First you need ssh-agent:

Then you need ssh keys:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
Which you have to add both to your local ssh-agent and to the github account.
